OLX Web Scraping Script

Ever wanted to find something in OLX with the right price but dont have the pacience to scroll 10's of pages?
Just use this script to find it. Adapt it to search for the thing you are looking for, open the outputfile and control-F that MF!

must install Cheerio and axios in order to run it!

npm install cheerio
npm install axios

Update: Now you can generate .CSV files. You can import them into EXCEL by clicking Data-> get data-> text/csv, and seting the separator as ";;".
